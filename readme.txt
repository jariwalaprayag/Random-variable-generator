Language used : Python

>>>python random_variable.py <number-of-samples> <distribution> <parameters> 

The excution of program starts at asking seed value to the user at line 4,
and commnd execution goes to line 235 to check which distribution to follow and accordinglly program call a function of corresponding distribution,
and gives sample, sample mean, sample variance, population mean and population variance for the particular distribution using its parameters.

Program can be run for following distributions
1. bernoulli distribution
2. binomial distribution
3. geometric distribution
4. negative binomial distribution
5. poisson distribution
6. arbitary discrete distribution
7. uniform distribution
8. exponential distribution
